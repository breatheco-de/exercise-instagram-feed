## 🌱  How to start this project

Do not clone this repository because we are going to be using a different template.

We recommend opening the `html template repository` using a provisioning tool like [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-github-codespaces) (recommended) or [Gitpod](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-use-gitpod). Alternatively, you can clone it to your local computer using the `git clone` command.

This is the repository you need to open:
