## 🌱  How to start this project

This project does not come with the necessary files to start working, we recommend you start coding from an empty boilerplate.

a) If using Gitpod you [click here to open the boilerplate](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/html-hello).  

b) If working locally type the following command from your command line: 

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/html-hello
```

💡 Important: Remember to create a new repository to save your progress and add the new remote (`git remote add new_origin <your new url>`), and upload the code to your new repository using `add`, `commit` and `git push new_origin <branch>`.
